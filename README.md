Tic-Tac-Toe with the objective of achieving optimal play, ensuring it never loses a game. The project involved creating a 3x3 grid to represent the game board, implementing game rules for legal moves and state checks, and enabling player interaction. The AI strategy was based on the Minimax algorithm, enhanced with Alpha-Beta pruning to optimize decision-making by evaluating all possible moves and selecting the best one. The project also included a user-friendly, console-based interface for smooth gameplay and interaction. This AI-driven Tic-Tac-Toe guarantees optimal play, making it an exciting venture into game development and AI. The tech stack used includes Python, Minimax algorithm, and a console-based UI.
